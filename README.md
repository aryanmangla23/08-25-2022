Woke up at 4 studied joy luck club till 7:40. Went to school and studied for another 30 minutes in the library before school started. Statistics was free. AP bio was free. nothing interesting. Brunch = more studying in library for joy luck club. 3rd period write joy luck club essay. I think i did aite. not rly sure. hopefully a 21/25 or better. After essay, watched movie in class while doing AP bio hw. Finished 1/2 the hw. After class, went to get lunch and then met soohyuk rohit ruiqi and alex and walked to soohyuk/josephs house. Studied nonstop for 6hours on Stats hw, japanese hw, gov hw which is completely done. And did AP bio, but still have to finish 10 pages more of notes and finish up the partly done poem for AP lit.
